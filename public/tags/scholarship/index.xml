      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people asked me about this, so in this post I am sharing with you my experience in getting an Erasmus Mundus scholarship for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.secclo.eu/&#34;&gt;SECCLO&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-graduated-my-bachelors&#34;&gt;I graduated my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hmm that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it on this section. I graduated :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-applied-to-australia-awards-scholarship&#34;&gt;I applied to Australia Awards Scholarship&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few months later, I tried applying for a scholarship. I was not aiming to get the scholarship, but rather to get the experience of applying for scholarships, so that I would get the hang of it. As expected, I did not get the scholarship, I did not even pass the first phase of the selection process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no right or wrong in writing a motivation letter. In this post, I merely show you how I wrote mine which got me a scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-things-first-who-am-i--why-should-you-trust-me&#34;&gt;First things first: Who am I &amp;amp; why should you trust me?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was granted an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to pursue a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.secclo.eu/&#34;&gt;SECCLO&lt;/a&gt;, co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I followed these guidelines you are about to read and I got the scholarship. But feel free to disagree!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
