      <description>A lot of people asked me about this, so in this post I am sharing with you my experience in getting an Erasmus Mundus scholarship for the SECCLO program.
I graduated my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Hmm that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it on this section. I graduated :)
I applied to Australia Awards Scholarship A few months later, I tried applying for a scholarship.</description>

      <description>There is no right or wrong in writing a motivation letter. In this post, I merely show you how I wrote mine which got me a scholarship.
First things first: Who am I &amp;amp; why should you trust me? I was granted an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to pursue a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in SECCLO, co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.</description>
