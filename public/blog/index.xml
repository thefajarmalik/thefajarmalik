&lt;p>Hmm that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it on this section. I graduated :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A few months later, I tried applying for a scholarship. I was not aiming to get the scholarship, but rather to get the experience of applying for scholarships, so that I would get the hang of it. As expected, I did not get the scholarship, I did not even pass the first phase of the selection process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things to consider when writing motivation letter for scholarships</title><link>https://thefajarmalik.com/blog/scholarship-motivation-letter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 16:00:31 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://thefajarmalik.com/blog/scholarship-motivation-letter/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There is no right or wrong in writing a motivation letter. In this post, I merely show you how I wrote mine which got me a scholarship.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="first-things-first-who-am-i--why-should-you-trust-me">First things first: Who am I &amp;amp; why should you trust me?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was granted an Erasmus Mundus scholarship to pursue a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in &lt;a href="https://www.secclo.eu/">SECCLO&lt;/a>, co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I followed these guidelines you are about to read and I got the scholarship. But feel free to disagree!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
