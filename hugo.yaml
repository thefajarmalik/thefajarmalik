    Title: Hello world!
    Content: I’m a soon-to-be graduate in cybersecurity, excited to start my career in this field. I’m passionate about keeping systems secure and staying ahead of threats. When I’m not working on tech, you’ll find me on the court playing badminton, tennis, or hitting the slopes skiing in the winter, or just playing Counter-Strike at home.
