From COVID-19 risk mapper, competition-winning software, to secure cryptographic protocol.

### Pseudonymous Authentication Protocol

I addressed the challenge of **enabling authenticated access to a third-party service without revealing user identities**. I designed and implemented a privacy-preserving authentication protocol, developing a full-stack prototype to demonstrate its functionality. Formal verification with ProVerif confirmed the protocol's security properties, and the master's thesis work received a very good grade (4/5).

**Technologies:** Python, Docker, Shell Script, Javascript, ProVerif

### IoT System Tracking Dashboard

For a client project, I developed the Android app for Smoke Beefs, an IoT-based animal growth tracking system. The app functioned as a real-time monitoring dashboard for livestock growth data. **The project won bronze medal on a prestigious national competition**, highlighting its innovation and technical excellence.

**Technologies:** Android Studio, Kotlin, Firebase, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors

### COVID-19 Risk Mapper

I tackled the challenge of improving community COVID-19 risk assessment by combining diverse data sources. I developed AHPSAW, an advanced risk mapping model integrating medical, geographic, demographic, and meteorological data. The model calculates the risks using **analytical methods** and **machine learning**. The calculation was designed **according to research** about factors affecting COVID-19 spread. The project achieved the **maximum grade** as my bachelorâ€™s thesis.

**Technologies:** Android Studio, Kotlin, Firebase, Weather API

### Farmer-Agronomist Forum

To solve the challenge of farmers lacking guidance on what crops to plant and when to plant them, I developed a mobile app that **connects farmers with agronomists** for agricultural guidance. The project was delivered as a client project.

**Technologies:** Android Studio, Kotlin, Firebase

### Product Catalogue

To showcase their products, I developed a website for a client, who manufactures leather goods. I used WordPress **so that my clients do not need me** if they want to change something in the website, no coding skills needed.

**Technologies:** Wordpress
