I addressed the challenge of enabling authenticated access to a third-party service without revealing user identities.

Formal verification with ProVerif confirmed the protocol's security properties, and the master's thesis work received a very good grade (4/5).

**Technologies:** Python, Docker, Shell Script, Javascript, ProVerif.
