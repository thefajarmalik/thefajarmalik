  **Hei! Moi!** My name is **Fajar** Malik. My journey has taken me from **Indonesia**&nbsp;🇮🇩 to **Finland**&nbsp;🇫🇮 and **Norway**&nbsp;🇳🇴. It began with my **Bachelor's in Computer Science from UGM**, where I also worked to deliver **14 software solutions in a year &mdash; all on time, within budget, and with 100% client acceptance**. Alongside this, I also developed **Android and web applications**, including an **competition-winning project at the national level**. My focus has always been on creating solutions that **solve real client problems**, not just ticking technical boxes.
  <br><br>
  During my studies in **Finland** and **Norway**, I built on this foundation through **hands-on** roles in **cyber security and cloud computing**. It started with **guiding students through hands-on cyber security challenges**, not only helped them to succeed but also **strengthened my mastery of the topics**. I went on to develop **backend** components for an **automated testing** system, resolving a **critical security vulnerability** in the process. For my **master's thesis**, I addressed a privacy concern by designing a **privacy-preserving (pseudonymous) cloud authentication protocol**, implemented as a full-stack **prototype** and **verified formally**.
  <br><br>
  I bring this **wide range of skills** with **structured, detail-oriented approach** to **help** organizations **build secure, practical systems** they can rely on.
