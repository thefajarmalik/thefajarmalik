  Hi! I am Fajar Malik, a security specialist and software developer with double master's degree in Security & Cloud, now looking for opportunities within the fields of cyber security, software development, and IT consulting, as well as any combination of them. Recently, I was honored to participate in the Collaboration Chronicles by Embassy of Finland in Jakarta, showcasing people with notable contribution to Finland-Indonesia cooperation.  I was also honored with the prestigious Erasmus Mundus Scholarship for my master studies (~3.5% acceptance rate).

  When I’m not working on tech, you’ll find me on the court playing badminton, hitting the slopes skiing in the winter, or just chilling at home probably playing Counter Strike.
