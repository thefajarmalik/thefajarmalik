Having almost finished my study in cybersecurity in the [SECCLO](https://www.secclo.eu/) master's program, I often find myself thinking how to compromise / attack a system, be it a digital or just a physical system.

For example, a few months ago, I was trying out watches in a jewellery store in Helsinki on a cold winter day. The watches they were selling there were priced moderately (not luxury watches). I noticed that they have their mirrors, that were used for checking how the watch would look on you, placed near the exit. I told them while half-joking:
> "That's an interesting placement for the mirror. What if I am here to steal the watch? I can just pretend to be trying the watch and then leave and run away!"

I ended up not buying any watch from that store though, sorry! üòÅ

Watch the following YouTube shorts video of a locksmith helping a client:

When the locksmith managed to get the keys locked inside, he asked his customer, "Which one is the key?". I immediately thought, "Oh that's so cool how he tried confirming that the customer is indeed the homeowner."

Reflecting on everything I mentioned above, I don't think I can go back to a normal mindset, which is to simply use the system. I will forever try to find attacks that can happen in that system and how they can be mitigated. Also, cybersecurity is not what you think it is! üòÖ
