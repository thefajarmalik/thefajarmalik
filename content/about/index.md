## 💼 Work Experience

**Research Assistant (Master's Thesis)** | Feb 2024 - Sep 2024  
<br/>[*Aalto University*](https://www.aalto.fi/en) 📍 Espoo, Finland 🇫🇮

As part of my master's thesis, I tackled a crtical challenge in secure digital interactions: enabling authenticated access to an external service without revealing the user's identty to that service.
- **Problem**: Organizations often need to authenticate users when redirecting them to third-party services, but sharing user IDs with those services can raise privacy concerns.
- **What I did**: I designed and implemented a privacy preserving (pseudonymous) authentication protocol that allows secure and authenticated access while keeping user identities hidden from the external provider. I developed a full-stack prototype (frontend & backend) to demonstrate the protocol's functionality.
- **Verification**: Ensured the protocol's security properties through formal verification using ProVerif.  
- **Technologies used**: Python, Docker, Linux Shell Scripting (Bash), JavaScript, ProVerif, REST API.

🎯 **Key achievements**: The work was awarded a very good grade (4/5).
